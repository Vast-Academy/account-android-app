# UI Changes Checklist

Use this checklist whenever UI-related code is touched.

- [ ] Which screens changed?
- [ ] Update docs/ui-baseline.md if the expected UI changed.
- [ ] Verify Add Account modal still matches baseline (header, preview card, tabs, icons/colors, CTA).
- [ ] Verify account detail menus still match baseline (bottom-up popup + icons).
- [ ] Capture 1 screenshot per changed screen (optional but recommended).
